## I solve Real World problems!  
### Projects for Transformation Waco  

#### [Two Embedded Estimators](https://github.com/Baylex/TW_Estimators)  
I designed two qualification calculators to help teachers understand their eligibility for the Teacher Incentive Allotment, a potential $65,000 pay increase!    

#### [Sentiment Analysis NLP](https://github.com/Baylex/TW_Survey_NLP)  Code coming soon!    
I have streamlined our data collection process and have recovered 1000 work hours or roughly $45,000 in salaries plus created actionable data from previously ignored data attributes.  

#### [Bernie Sanders Meme - Converting Images](https://github.com/Baylex/TW_Bernie_Sanders_Converting_Images)   
I used Python to convert several logo images for a communication flyer.  The communication team wanted the logos to match with the same black and white color scheme.   

## My work has Impact and Reach! 
### Projects for Educational Service Center Region 13, Austin, TX

#### [Data Dig Protocol](https://store.esc13.net/collections/frontpage/products/data-dig-protocol-tool?variant=39316497727561)
I was contracted to bring the Data Dig Protocol to life, which retails for $1200.  From my years of leading data PLCs, I have learned the best, most efficient way for teachers to analyze their data in a meaningful way that improves student performance.  I used Google Sheets to create a collaborative document that takes in data from 2 different student information systems, Eduphoria! and DMAC, which are the  2 most common SIS systems in Texas.  Once the data is in place, I wrote all the code and formulas to automatically calculate and present everything the way a teacher needs to process the information.
